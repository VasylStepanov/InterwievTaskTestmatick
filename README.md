Task: Provided objects-figures of the following types: square, triangle, circle and trapezoid. Each figure can be drawn, its area and color parameters can be obtained. Figures also have unique methods, e.g. return radius, hypotenuse length, side length, etc.

We need to generate a random set of figures, the number of objects in the set is also unknown in advance.
